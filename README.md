# Crazy Western
A videogame programmed by Víctor Sánchez and David Roel, both students of Ironhack. This project is mainly coded in JavaScript, but it contains some HTML & CSS in order to make a proper presentation.

## A crazy game... Really
This game was designed to be... different, unconventional. A cowboy in Mars has to save the babies that martians have stolen from the Earth. Stay alive while you encounter enemies and meteorites. Use the platforms to help yourself, and keep going until you find our "BIG" surprise :wink:

You can play it [here](https://cifox92.github.io/crazy-western/)

## Controls
Quite simple!... Or not. We even have difficulties to win the game! but here are the controls anyway:

```bash
Left & right arrow keys: move back & forth
Space: Jump
B: Shoot
N: Reload
```

## Enemies!
Three types of enemies: one runs towards you, another one comes jumping (more difficult to shoot at) and... the "BIG" surprise if you reach the end. The two first types of enemies are spawned by probability.

## Power-up
There is just one power-up controlled by the number of coins you earn by killing enemies or saving babies. Eevery 150 coins you get +1 life. Remember:

* Running enemy gives you +5 coins.
* Jumping enemy gives you +10 coins.
* Saving babies gives you +20 coins.

## Score
Every enemy you kill and every baby you save gives you score! Which is equivalent to the number of coins you get. Try to get as much as you can!

## Contributing
This is our first project as Ironhackers! Any feedback will be really appreciated.
